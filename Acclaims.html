Their technical ability and <br>musicality was of the highest standard and a mirror image of Scott's skill as a <br> teacher and his enthusiasm for the guitar. A few lucky teachers are fortunate enough to <br> have one exceptionally talented student but Scott has had so many it cannot be the <br> result of luck. He has the rare gift of motivating and making his pupils enthusiastic <br> about guitar playing. Scott’s open minded attitude towards anything new or different <br> and his hunger to learn put him on the very frontier of a changing guitar world. Scott <br> is surely one of the most inspiring guitar teachers of our <br>time. " -- Peter and Zoltan Katona</em>
