            My goal as a teacher is to nourish each student’s love of music and desire for learning by providing an <br>
            engaging, step by step path to develop musical ability. I strive to honor the great beauty and communicative <br>
            power of music that attracts people to the study of an instrument. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Because music is an expressive art, I begin by becoming acquainted with with each student’s individual <br>
            motivation for study and I expose students to the expressive qualities of music from many different cultures <br>
            and periods of history. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Because mastering a musical instrument calls for an integration of mind and body, I emphasize  physical <br>
            awareness and ease as well as broad musical knowledge. In weekly lessons students study technique, music <br>
            theory, ear training, improvisation, principles of learning, repertoire and performance. <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Music allows us to better understand our inner life as well as the different perspectives of other people, <br>
            cultures and historical periods. The study and performance of music makes the world a better place. <br>
        </p>

            <em>“The artist in ancient times inspired, entertained and educated fellow citizens. Modern artists have an <br>
            additional responsibility - to encourage others to be artists. Each of us must in some way be a creator as <br>
            well as a spectator or consumerism will destroy the soul. Make your own music!” <br>
                --<strong>Yehudi Menuhin</strong></em><br>

            <em>“The man who hath no music in himself, nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds, is fit for treasons, <br>
            strategems, and spoils; the motions of his spirit are dull as night, and his affections dark as Erebus. Let <br>
            no such man be trusted.” <br>
